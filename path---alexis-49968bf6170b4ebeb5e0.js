I canâ€™t believe that itâ€™s already been close to 3 years since I first attended Hack Club and you taught me all those neat Javascript tips and tricks. All the hack nights and hackathons in SF were a blast. Now Iâ€™m in my first year at UCSB, learning about crazy stuff like automata and abstract data structures like red/black trees. Itâ€™s a lot to handle but thanks to you Iâ€™m sure that Iâ€™ll be able to hack my way through. Iâ€™ll never forget how you motivated me to be creative and use programming to express myself. Now I can make pretty much anything I want, no matter how wacky or dumb. I hope you continue to inspire those around you and give them the same energy, and I hope you take some time to celebrate your birthday. Youâ€™re awesome.</p>",frontmatter:{author:"alexis"}}},pathContext:{author:"alexis"}}}});
