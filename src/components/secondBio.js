      I've seen you growing up. (Tum mery hathoon mein barri hui ho ðŸ˜‚).
      From 16th November 2014 to till date we have been through lots of ups and downs.
      But this day is giving a special message that we can bear eachother more
      than anyone else has ever thought or wished. Here's my one wish to celebrate
      many more birthdays with you. I pray that may your smile never fade away
      and may your skin remains pimples free this coming year(A big Ameen).
      For more prayers and wishes you know where to call me. ðŸ˜‚
    <br/>
      Here are some of your pictures please take a look.
