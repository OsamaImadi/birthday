Many thanks for replying to all my requests for help with code and general advice to normal teenager problems ðŸ˜›.</p>\n<p>Your sleep schedule is also the craziest Iâ€™ve ever heard ofâ€”grinding for 24 hours and then crashing for 12 is both a remarkable and frightening feat.

We only hung out for a dayâ€”not enough time in my opinionâ€¦that definitely needs to be changed.
